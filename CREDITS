First, great thanks to original authors of the Netwide Assembler -
Julian Hall <jules@dsf.org.uk> and Simon Tatham <anakin@pobox.com> .
Without your excellent software RadiOS would never appear.

Of course, I didn't write everything from scratch, most of the stuff came
from different OSes and kernels (in slightly modified form, though ;)
Some of them are:

LSD (OS-32),	David Lindauer <camille@bluegrass.net>
TINOS,		Bart Sekura <bsekura@impaq.com.pl>
Minix 2.0,	Kees J. Bot <kjb@cs.vu.nl>
Linux 2.0.0	Linus Torvalds <torvalds@transmeta.com> and others
L4-KA RC2	Uwe Dannowski <uwe.dannowski@ira.uka.de> and others

C stuff is compiled with LCC 4.1, NASM module was provided by
John Coffman <johninsd@san.rr.com>. Thanks John and all LCC authors.

Finally, warm greetings to Jussi Kallioniemi <jukal@cyberian.org>.
Without his kind help I definitely wouldn't compose these bits in N years.

Best regards,
Yuri Zaporogets <yuriz@teraflops.com>
