; RadiOS history
;****************

Mar 03, 1998	My first attempt to code something very low-level. It called
		"The Hawk Operating System", though it was only a program
		running in MS-DOS. Turbo C 2.0 was used to compile. The
		project died quite soon.
		
Sep 23, 1998	Me and Serhiy Danilov <sdaniloff@postmark.net> decided to
		write our own operating system. I suggested the name -
		"Radionix".

Oct 25, 1998	Serhiy gave up to continue Radionix, and it was right decision.
		The OS concept (x86 real-mode, no protection) was wrong
		from the beginning. So I packed together all Radionix
		stuff and decided to write a new system from scratch.
		The main reason for it was an idea of new file system
		(based on so-called "bad & busy bitmaps" concept). Of course,
		it would run completely in the protected CPU mode.

Oct 26, 1998	I decided to call a new system "ZealOS". Funny, but real
		ZealOS project (http://zealos.org) was started by Mark Zealey
		only two years later :)

Oct 31, 1998	ZealOS protected mode initialization works.

Nov 24, 1998	Some hardware control routines work (keyboard, VGA text mode,
		PIC and PIT). Device driver infrastructure started.

Nov 26, 1998	This is an "official" date of launching the RadiOS project.
==*=*==*=*==	I just took a ZealOS snapshot, wrote some Makefiles and
		changed the name. First version number for RadiOS was d0.01,
		and it hasn't been changed for quite long time.

Jan 28, 1999	Version d0.01-build6: some monitor commands work.

Jul 11, 1999	Version d0.01-PD1.0-build4:

Sep 14, 1999	Version d0.01-PD1.0-build8:

Nov 13, 1999	Transition to NASM and RDOFF2 completed.
------------

Mar 01, 2000	Version 0.01-00LS: RadiOS builds on Unix (Linux and FreeBSD)

Aug 13, 2000	Version 0.0.1-cvs0: I imported the whole RadiOS tree to local
		CVS, and decided to change the versioning scheme. Soon I
		dropped this idea (mostly because of those annoying CVS/
		directories :), but "-cvsXXX" stuck for more than a year.

Sep 19, 2000	Version 0.0.1-cvs2: first GPLed release of RadiOS

Dec 13, 2000	Version 0.0.1-cvs007: after two weeks of hacking, multitasking
		primitives are ready. Two kernel threads run simultaneously.
