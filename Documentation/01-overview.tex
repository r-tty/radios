\section{Overview}

The Radiant Operating System (RadiOS) is based on microkernel technology.
It resembles many design ideas and implementation techniques of QNX RTOS 6
and VSTa.
\\
RadiOS microkernel (\textbf{rmk}) and major part of the Task Manager are
written in x86 assembly language (NASM). Some parts (like boot-time linker)
are written in ANSI C.
\\
Key features of RadiOS are:
\begin{itemize}
\item True microkernel architecture based on synchronous message passing
\item High degree of modularity
\item POSIX compatibility
\end{itemize}
