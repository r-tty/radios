First, great thanks to original authors of the Netwide Assembler -
Julian Hall <jules@dsf.org.uk> and Simon Tatham <anakin@pobox.com> .
Without your excellent software RadiOS would never exist in its present form.

Of course, I didn't write everything from scratch, most of the stuff came
from different OSes and kernels (in slightly modified form, though ;)
Some of them are:

VSTa,		Andy Valencia <vandys@vsta.org>
TINOS,		Bart Sekura <bsekura@impaq.com.pl>
OS-32,		David Lindauer <camille@bluegrass.net>
Minix 2.0,	Kees J. Bot <kjb@cs.vu.nl> and others
QNX 6.1,	QNX Software Systems Ltd (http://www.qnx.com)
x-kernel,	University of Arizona (http://www.cs.arizona.edu/xkernel)

C stuff is compiled with LCC 4.2, NASM module was provided by
John Coffman <johninsd@san.rr.com>. Thanks John and all LCC authors.

Finally, warm greetings to Jussi Kallioniemi <jukal@cyberian.org>.
Without his kind help I definitely wouldn't compose these bits in N years.
