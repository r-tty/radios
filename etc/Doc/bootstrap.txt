 RadiOS bootstrap process
 ------------------------
 
1) Multiboot-compilant loader loads RadiOS kernel at address 110000h.
   Optionally up to 16 boot-time modules can be loaded after a kernel.
   
2) Multiboot-compilant loader passes execution to kernel at address 110030h.
   There is a small "mover" at this address (embedded into RDM by a linker,
   see docs to "ldrdf"). "Mover" just moves a kernel loader (which is the
   last 4096 bytes of kernel image) to a new location (unused video page - 
   0BF000h) and passes execution to loader.
   
3) Loader/linker does following:
    a) moves kernel code and data sections to lower memory (start of code
       section is 1000h, data section follows after code, it aligns on a
       paragraph boundary);
    b) does relocation using relocation records stored in RDM file;
    c) clears kernel BSS space;
    d) builds two tables of system call entries. First table is for "driver
       helpers" (syscalls used by loadable drivers), second one is for
       user programs;
    e) relocates and links to kernel all loaded modules (using already bulit
       driver helper and user API tables);
    f) passes execution to kernel (entry point is determined by label 'Start').
    
    
 Memory layout after kernel startup
 ----------------------------------
 
 0      - 3FFh		  Unused
 400h   - 4FFh		  BIOS data area
 500h   - 5FFh		  Startup configuration table
 600h   - 6FFh		  Boot modules list (up to 16 modules)
 700h   - 7FFh		  Boot-time kernel variables (initialized by loader)
 800h   - FFFh		  Unused (loader buffers and stack)
 1000h  - [KernelData]-1  Kernel code section
 [KernelData] - [KernelBSS]-1	Kernel data section
 [KernelBSS] - [DrvHlpTbl]-1	Kernel BSS
 [DrvHlpTbl] - [UAPITbl]-1	Driver helpers table (RDM export records)
 [UAPITbl] - [KPagePool]-1	User APIs table (RDM export records)
 [KPagePool] - 87FFFh		Kernel page pool
 88000h - 9FFFFh		Kernel init stack
