\section{RadiOS bootstrap process}

RadiOS microkernel (\textbf{rmk}) is Multiboot compliant, so it can be booted
using Multiboot loader, such as GRUB.
\\
\textbf{rmk} consists of

\begin{enumerate}
\item Boot loader (GRUB) loads the kernel (rmk586.rdm.gz) to memory at
      the address specified in multiboot trampoline (stored as a RDOFF
      generic record). This address is usually 110000h. Additional boot
      modules may be loaded as well.
\item Execution is passed to a multiboot trampoline (at the address 110030h).
      Trampoline moves the Boot Time Linker, stored at the end of kernel
      file, to its working area (HMA) and passes execution to it.
\item Boot Time Linker (BTL) initializes the rest of HMA (64 kilobyte area
      located at 100000h and used exclusively by a BTL) with zeros. This
      area is used as BTL's BSS, boot parameters structure and as a buffer
      for BIOS memory map.
\item BTL links all boot modules and relocates the kernel to its working area,
      then calls the kernel.
\end{enumerate}
