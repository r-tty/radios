 RadiOS bootstrap process
 ------------------------
 
1) Multiboot-compliant loader loads RadiOS kernel at address 110000h.
   Optionally up to 16 boot-time modules can be loaded after a kernel.
   
2) Multiboot-compliant loader passes execution to kernel at address 110030h.
   There is a trampoline routine at this address (embedded into kernel
   header by a linker), that copies setup block (last 4096 bytes of kernel
   image) to a its working location (100000h) and passes execution to it.
   
3) Setup block does following:
    a) moves kernel code and data sections to lower memory (start of code
       section is 4000h, data section follows after code, it aligns on a
       paragraph boundary);
    b) does relocation using relocation records stored in RDM file;
    c) clears kernel BSS space;
    d) builds two tables of system call entries. First table is for "driver
       helpers" (syscalls used by loadable drivers), second one is for
       user programs;
    e) passes execution to kernel (entry point is determined by label 'Start').
