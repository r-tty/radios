ip.c ip_control.c  ip_hdr.c ip_i.h ip_input.c were merged
from david's versions and the version in merge branch  
on Oct 26th, 1994.

ip_control.c, ip_i.h was copied from merge branch directly.

I ommitted removing the static decl from david's versions
of some functions.

ip.c: inline get_ident could not be used because inline
is not supported by ansi C.

ip_input.c: Did not add following lines: (arenet they dependent
on integer formating per arch? Talk to david.
     #if 0
	ph.src = h->source;
	ph.dst = h->dest;
        ph.zero = 0;
        ph.prot = h->prot;
        ph.len = htons( msgLen(dg) );
     #else
        *((int*)&ph.src) = *((int*)&h->source);
        *((int*)&ph.dst) = *((int*)&h->dest);
        *((int*)&ph.zero) = (htons(msgLen(dg)) << 16) | (h->prot << 8);
     #endif
ip_input.c: Has reference to mapResolve2
