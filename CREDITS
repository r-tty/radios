First, great thanks to original authors of the Netwide Assembler -
Julian Hall <jules@dsf.org.uk> and Simon Tatham <anakin@pobox.com> .
Without your excellent software RadiOS would never appear.

Of course, I didn't write everything from scratch, most of the stuff came
from different OSes and kernels (in slightly modified form, though ;)
Some of them are:

VSTa,		 Andy Valencia <vandys@vsta.org>
TINOS,		 Bart Sekura <bsekura@impaq.com.pl>
OS-32,		 David Lindauer <camille@bluegrass.net>

C stuff is compiled with LCC 4.2, NASM module was provided by
John Coffman <johninsd@san.rr.com>. Thanks John and all LCC authors.

Finally, warm greetings to Jussi Kallioniemi <jukal@cyberian.org>.
Without his kind help I definitely wouldn't compose these bits in N years.

Best regards,
Yuri Zaporogets <yuriz@teraflops.com>
